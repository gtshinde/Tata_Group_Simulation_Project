# Online Retail Dataset Analysis and Data Cleaning
## Problem Statement:
The business aims to analyze its sales data to uncover insights that drive strategic decision-making. Specifically, we seek to address the following:

- Revenue Trends: Understanding monthly and seasonal revenue fluctuations to identify growth opportunities and optimize sales strategies.
- Country-wise Revenue Contribution: Evaluating the average revenue generated by each country to pinpoint high-performing and underperforming regions.
- Customer Behavior: Analyzing customer purchasing patterns to improve retention and personalize marketing efforts.
- Campaign and Product Effectiveness: Measuring the impact of marketing campaigns and identifying top-performing products to enhance ROI and product positioning.

The goal is to provide actionable insights to the CEO and CMO, enabling data-driven strategies for revenue growth, market expansion, and operational efficiency.

## Executive Summary
A comprehensive analysis was conducted on 541k+ purchase transactions, addressing data quality issues like missing values, negative quantities, and pricing errors to create a reliable dataset of 540k records. Key findings revealed that 50% of transactions were from guest accounts, contributing 16% of total revenue, signaling an opportunity to convert one-time buyers into loyal customers. Q4 was the strongest-performing quarter, with November leading in revenue ($1.5M). Six countries, with the Netherlands, Ireland, and Germany being the top contributors, generated 95% of total sales. Seasonal trends and regional sales were visualized in an interactive Power BI dashboard, identifying peak sales periods and high-demand products. These insights highlight opportunities for strategic customer retention, market-specific growth strategies, and optimized resource allocation during high-demand periods.

## Data Quality Issues and Cleaning Approaches
### Missing Values
- **Description**: 1,454 records with missing product descriptions.
- **CustomerID**: 135,080 records with missing CustomerID values (~50% of the dataset).

**Approach**:
- Removed rows with missing product descriptions.
- Retained rows with missing CustomerID as they may represent guest purchases.

### Negative Quantities
- **Details**: 10,624 records with negative quantities.

**Approach**:
- Removed negative quantities as they were entered incorrectly as per the info provided by Tata team.

### Price Issues
- **Details**: 2,517 records with zero or negative prices.

**Approach**:
- Investigated and removed rows with zero or negative prices as they were deemed errors.

### Cancelled Transactions
- **Details**: 9,288 cancelled invoices (invoices starting with 'C').

**Approach**:
- Added a 'Transaction_Type' column to distinguish returns (invoices starting with 'C') from purchases.

## Modifications Applied
- Added a new column, **'Transaction_Type'**, to categorize transactions as Returns or Purchases.
- Removed rows with missing product descriptions.
- Removed rows with zero or negative prices & negative quantities.
- Added a **'Total_Value'** column calculated as `Quantity * UnitPrice`.

## Dataset Reduction
- Original rows: **541,909**
- Cleaned rows: **540,453**
- The cleaning process preserved most of the data while addressing problematic entries.

## Additional Observations
- The dataset includes transactions from **37 different countries**.
- Missing CustomerID values are likely due to guest checkouts.
